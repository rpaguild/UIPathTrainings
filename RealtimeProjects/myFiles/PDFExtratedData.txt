Dear Representative Name:

I am writing you concerning a recent purchase of promotional items. Approximately two weeks ago, on
May 1, I ordered a total of 500 promotional items for Company, Inc. via the Promotional items webpage. I
received an email notification within three hours confirming the receipt of payment via credit card and the
prompt shipment of promotional items.  Your website indicated, shipments should reach their destination
within 3-5 business days of being sent, but I am eagerly awaiting to receive the promotional items. Do you
have any information on what may have happened with shipment or where the shipment is located?

I have worked with name of company before and have confidence in your product lines and excellent
customer service. The shipment of promotional items must arrive soon, and I hoped you might be able to
provide me with an idea of when I can receive them in our office. Thank you in advance for assistance you
may provide regarding the purchase.

Sincerely,

Your name
